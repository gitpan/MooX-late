 [ Documentation ]
 - Make the list of stuff this module does more concise.

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Improve test cases for class type constraints.

 [ Packaging ]
 - Depend on Moo 1.006000.
 - Depend on Type::Utils 1.000001.

 [ Other ]
 - Removed: Drop support for `coerce => 1` because Moo 1.006000 supports
   this natively now.

0.014	2013-07-16

 - Added: Support `coerce => 1` for Type::Tiny type constraints and those
   providing a similar API.

0.013	2013-07-16

 - Added: Support Moose attribute traits using MooX::HandlesVia.
 - Removed: Retire support for non-reference attribute defaults because Moo
   now does this natively.
 - Updated: Use Type::Utils::dwim_type to translate strings to type
   constraint expressions.

0.012	2013-06-28

 - Updated: Use Type::Registry/Type::Parser to translate strings to type
   constraint expressions.

   SHLOMIF++

0.010	2013-04-23

 [ Packaging ]

0.004	2012-12-03

 - Added: Issue warnings when type constraint cannot be interpreted
   correctly. Warning is not issued at the time the attribute is built, but
   the first time the type constraint is checked against. Don't attempt to
   inflate these type constraints when Moose is loaded.

0.003	2012-12-02

 - Added: Inflation of type constraints to Moose.
 - General refactoring of type constraint code.
 - Use MooX::Types::MooseLike::Base for type checks.

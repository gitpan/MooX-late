NAME
    MooX::late - easily translate Moose code to Moo

SYNOPSIS
       package Foo;
       use Moo;
       use MooX::late;
       has bar => (is => "ro", isa => "Str", default => "MacLaren's Pub");

    (Examples for Moo roles in section below.)

DESCRIPTION
    Moo is a light-weight object oriented programming framework which aims
    to be compatible with Moose. It does this by detecting when Moose has
    been loaded, and automatically "inflating" its classes and roles to full
    Moose classes and roles. This way, Moo classes can consume Moose roles,
    Moose classes can extend Moo classes, and so forth.

    However, the surface syntax of Moo differs somewhat from Moose. For
    example the "isa" option when defining attributes in Moose must be
    either a string or a blessed Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint object; but in
    Moo must be a coderef. These differences in surface syntax make porting
    code from Moose to Moo potentially tricky. MooX::late provides some
    assistance by enabling a slightly more Moosey surface syntax.

    MooX::late does the following:

    1.  Allows "isa => $string" to work when defining attributes for all
        Moose's built-in type constraints (and assumes other strings are
        package names).

        This feature requires Types::Standard.

    2.  Allows "default => $non_reference_value" to work when defining
        attributes.

    3.  Allows "lazy_build => 1" to work when defining attributes.

    4.  Exports "blessed" and "confess" functions to your namespace.

    Four features. It is not the aim of "MooX::late" to make every aspect of
    Moo behave exactly identically to Moose. It's just going after the
    low-hanging fruit. So it does four things right now, and I promise that
    future versions will never do more than seven.

  Use in Moo::Roles
    MooX::late should work in Moo::Roles, with no particular caveats.

       package MyRole;
       use Moo::Role;
       use MooX::late;

    Package::Variant can be used to build the Moo equivalent of
    parameterized roles. MooX::late should work in roles built with
    Package::Variant.

       use Package::Variant
          importing => ['MooX::Role' => ['late']],
          subs      => [ qw(has with) ];

SEE ALSO
    "MooX::late" uses Types::Standard to check type constraints.

    The following modules bring additional Moose functionality to Moo:

    *   MooX::Override - support override/super

    *   MooX::Augment - support augment/inner

    MooX::HandlesVia provides a native-traits-like feature for Moo. There
    are plans afoot to add MooX::HandlesVia magic to MooX::late.

    MooX allows you to load Moo plus multiple MooX extension modules in a
    single line.

NAME
    MooX::late - easily translate Moose code to Moo

SYNOPSIS
       package Foo;
       use Moo;
       use MooX::late;
       has bar => (is => "ro", isa => "Str", default => "MacLaren's Pub");

    (Examples for Moo roles in section below.)

DESCRIPTION
    Moo is a light-weight object oriented programming framework which aims
    to be compatible with Moose. It does this by detecting when Moose has
    been loaded, and automatically "inflating" its classes and roles to full
    Moose classes and roles. This way, Moo classes can consume Moose roles,
    Moose classes can extend Moo classes, and so forth.

    However, the surface syntax of Moo differs somewhat from Moose. For
    example the "isa" option when defining attributes in Moose must be
    either a string or a blessed Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint object; but in
    Moo must be a coderef. These differences in surface syntax make porting
    code from Moose to Moo potentially tricky. MooX::late provides some
    assistance by enabling a slightly more Moosey surface syntax.

    MooX::late does the following:

    1.  Allows "isa => $string" to work when defining attributes for all
        Moose's built-in type constraints (and assumes other strings are
        package names).

        This feature requires Types::Standard.

    2.  Retired feature: this is now built in to Moo.

        Allows "default => $non_reference_value" to work when defining
        attributes.

    3.  Allows "lazy_build => 1" to work when defining attributes.

    4.  Exports "blessed" and "confess" functions to your namespace.

    5.  Handles certain attribute traits. Currently "Hash", "Array" and
        "Code" are supported. This feature requires MooX::HandlesVia.

        "String", "Number", "Counter" and "Bool" are unlikely to ever be
        supported because of internal implementation details of Moo. If you
        need another attribute trait to be supported, let me know and I will
        consider it.

    6.  Supports "coerce => 1" if the type constraint is a blessed object
        implementing Type::API::Constraint::Coercible.

    Five features. It is not the aim of "MooX::late" to make every aspect of
    Moo behave exactly identically to Moose. It's just going after the
    low-hanging fruit. So it does five things right now, and I promise that
    future versions will never do more than seven.

  Use in Moo::Roles
    MooX::late should work in Moo::Roles, with no particular caveats.

       package MyRole;
       use Moo::Role;
       use MooX::late;

    Package::Variant can be used to build the Moo equivalent of
    parameterized roles. MooX::late should work in roles built with
    Package::Variant.

       use Package::Variant
          importing => [ qw( Moo::Role MooX::late ) ],
          subs      => [ qw( has with ) ];

  Type constraints
    Type constraint strings are interpreted using Type::Parser, using the
    type constraints defined in Types::Standard. This provides a very slight
    superset of Moose's type constraint syntax and built-in type
    constraints.

    Any unrecognized string that looks like it might be a class name is
    interpreted as a class type constraint.

  Subclassing
    MooX::late is designed to be reasonably easy to subclass. There are
    comments in the source code explaining hooks for extensibility.

SEE ALSO
    "MooX::late" uses Types::Standard to check type constraints.

    "MooX::late" uses MooX::HandlesVia to provide native attribute traits
    support.

    The following modules bring additional Moose functionality to Moo:

    *   MooX::Override - support override/super

    *   MooX::Augment - support augment/inner

    MooX allows you to load Moo plus multiple MooX extension modules in a
    single line.
